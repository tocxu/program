# Flask
A Minimal Application

A minimal Flask application looks something like this:
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

``If you are on Windows you need to use set instead of export.``

Alternatively you can use python -m flask:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ python -m flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```


# Easy to Setup
